After the battle, in which the Americans were routed, leaving subsequent smaller engagements following in its wake, the city became the British military and political base of operations in North America.

In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like &quot;girl&quot; and of words like &quot;oil&quot; become a diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced &quot;goil&quot; and ''oil'' is pronounced &quot;erl&quot;; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like &quot;Joizey&quot; (Jersey), &quot;Toidy-Toid Street&quot; (33rd St.) and &quot;terlet&quot; (toilet).&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s sitcom ''[[All in the Family]]'' was a good example of a speaker who had this feature.
